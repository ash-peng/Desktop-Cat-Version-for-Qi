# Desktop-Pets-For-Qi

A desktop rabbit and deer getting married, reminiscent of a real-life event that happened on Jan. 7th, 2023.

The rabbit (they/them) jumps left and right in a straight line, sometimes stops to rest, at other times thinks to themself, and their thoughts appear in the terminal window. If you wait long enough, you might see a message generated by GPT (the API key has to be filled in the code manually).

The deer (she/her) gallops in random directions and jupms back to check in with the rabbit once in a while. If you wait long enough the deer might breed.

The wedding decorations are based on real decorations of "Simple Love Coffee Home" in Vancouver, Canada, where the wedding took place in January 2023.
